### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an 18 y/o Computer Science undergrad who's already deep in the game of building, breaking, and rebuilding tech. I love crafting **interactive, meaningful** web experiences — the kind that aren't just usable but unforgettable. I don’t just code to solve problems — I code to **redefine** them.

- 🔭 Currently building **Scam Sniper** – an AI-powered, gamified web tool that detects online scams in real time using APIs like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Google Safe Browsing & more.
- 🎮 I gamify serious tech. From bomb-defusal puzzles to reflex-testing games – security doesn’t have to be boring.
- 🔐 Passionate about **cybersecurity, ethical hacking**, and everything that smells like challenge.
- 🎨 I craft immersive UIs with dark mode, live visualizations, glitch text, typewriter effects, and sound.

### 🧠 What I Love

- ✅ Building **real-world, impactful** projects that solve big problems
- 💡 Turning boring UIs into **story-driven user experiences**
- 🧪 Exploring **AI/ML, voice tech, and dark web leak detection**
- 📚 Self-learning outside the curriculum to stay ahead of the curve
- 🎤 Presenting my ideas clearly and convincingly (pitch decks, demos, docs – I got it covered)
